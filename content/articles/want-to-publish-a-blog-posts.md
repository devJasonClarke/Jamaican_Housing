# Want to publish blog post?

One misconception about starting a blog is that you need to be a good writer to be successful. Nothing is far from the truth. People read blog sites to get a personal view of things, so most bloggers write in a very informal and conversational way.

And because of the format, many successful bloggers will write articles on various topics on the same blog.

In addition, you don’t need to be an expert on any topic you write to have a successful blog. For example, visitors to cooking blogs don’t want to read food scientists’ textbooks, they want to hear about the experiences of people who have actually cooked, mistakes, and so on.

To become a successful blogger, there is really only one requirement: to be passionate about your topic.

Essentially, a blog is about sharing your knowledge with the world. Write down what you are passionate about to make the process of creating a successful blog easier. As long as you write about things you are really interested in, your enthusiasm will shine and keep your visitors interested.

So why are you in the trouble of blogging? There are several reasons:

- **Share your story**. A blog allows you to have a voice and be heard. If you want, you can share your story with the world. One of the most common ways to use a blog is as a diary, where bloggers write down their daily experiences so that friends, family, and others can become part of their lives.

- **Make money at home**. If done correctly, blogs can be very profitable. The world’s top bloggers obviously make a lot of money, but if done right, even part-time bloggers can make considerable profits. The best part about it is that blogs are a form of passive income, because you can only spend a few hours a week writing a piece of content, and then continue to profit from it for a long time after writing it. Later in this guide, I will explain in detail how to make money from a blog.

- **Recognition of yourself or your business**. No, because of your latest post, you may not have a paparazzi following you. But a successful blog can turn your ideas into reality and gain a lot of recognition in your respective fields. Many bloggers are called experts because of their blogs, and some even get deals for books and movies through their blogs.


Writing blog content is not like writing novels. You have a chance to attract and keep people's attention. Nothing loses your audience faster than a post containing a lot of unstructured text. People like to browse online content. You must consider this when writing a blog post. You need some subtitles as eye-catching, images to break down the text and maintain high attention.
