# Let us define the meaning of window-shopping and why people are “into it”?

“When we talk of the term window-shopping, we basically mean the process of looking at or browsing goods that are offered for sale. People engage in window-shopping mainly for two reasons. The first reason is because it is a form of a recreational activity. The second reason is because there is an intention of purchasing the things displayed later on.

Today, the act of window-shopping is not restricted to physical retail stores alone because of the fact that window-shopping is now done online. People can now use the internet to browse through items being sold on online shopping sites. There are so many companies which offer internet users the unique ability to sit in the comfort of their home and have access to online window-shopping”(source by hosbeg.com)
